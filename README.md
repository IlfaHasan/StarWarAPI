# Getting Started

This project is to display the first person that comes back from the Star War API endpoint. 

This project aims to understand the concept of mocking API response for testing purposes.We make use of msw to mock API response.

Here we aim to use a mock server to check the first person returned by the mock server is correctly being rendered on the screen.
